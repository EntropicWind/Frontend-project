My project is an excuse generator with different catagories, but i have also added the ability to fetch chuck norris facts as well.

On my home page. it explains that you have to select a catagory, the number of excuses that you want from 1-5
and then you hit the button to generate excuses. there is also another button to reset and do it again

At the top in my navigation bar. you have a button to go to chuck norris facts page and from there you can hit a button to retrive facts or reset and get new facts

Another link in the nav bar is to a "submit your own excuse" page where you can select the catagory and type in your submission. then you can click the submit button and it takes you to a confirmation page. 

The last link is the contact me page where you can submit yor basic information and there is a text box to write any issues and then there is a button to submit that takes you to a confirmation page. 

All the links are connected and able to freely move between each page and always return home.

some things that i learned from this project was that if i relax and have this time to work, i end up doing a lot better. i also have learned that i really enjoy using bootstrap and it has significantly helped me out.
